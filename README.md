# Incorrect Equality Check in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript involving incorrect equality checks using `==` instead of `===`.

The `bug.js` file contains a function with a flawed equality check that can lead to unexpected results when dealing with `null` or `undefined` values. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version using the strict equality operator (`===`).

## Bug Description
The `foo` function in `bug.js` uses loose equality (`==`) to check if arguments `a` and `b` are null. Loose equality can lead to type coercion, causing unexpected behavior. For instance, `0 == null` evaluates to `false`, but `0 === null` evaluates to `false`, which is the intended behavior for strict equality.  This inconsistency makes the code unreliable.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file replaces `==` with `===` which ensures that the comparison is strictly type-safe, resolving the issue. 

## Usage
Clone this repository and run the JavaScript files to observe the difference in behavior between the original buggy code and the corrected version.
